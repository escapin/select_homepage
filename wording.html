  <h2>welcome to sElect</h2>
  <p>
    sElect is an on-line voting system enabling votes to remain confidential while 
    providing voters the possibility to verify that their choices have been properly counted.
  </p>
  <p>
    sElect is designed to be particularly simple and lightweight in terms of its structure, 
    its user experience, and the cryptography it uses.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Despite its simplicity, sElect enjoys an high level of 
    <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>verifiability</strong>, and <strong>accountability</strong>
    for low-risk elections.

  <p></p>
  <ul class="small-image-list">
    <li>
      <h3>Human Verifiability</h3>
      <p>When casting their vote, voters receive a verification code which will
	appear in the election result along with their choice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Fully Automated Verification</h3>
      <p>Cryptographic checks are automatically performed within voters' browsers 
	as soon as they look at the election result, in order to ensure
	that no component of sElect has dropped or manipulated their ballots.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Simple Cryptography and Design</h3>
      <p>Unlike other e-voting systems, sElect employs only public key encryption 
	and digital signature, allowing the use of post-quantum cryptographic 
	primitives, if it becomes necessary.
